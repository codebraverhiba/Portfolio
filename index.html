        <p id="intro">Hello, my name is Hiba, and I am a dedicated student with a strong interest in web development and digital creation. I am passionate about transforming ideas into functional and visually appealing projects, and I continuously work to expand my skills in programming and design.</p>  
        <p id="intro">My journey in coding began with small experiments in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, those simple beginnings grew into a deeper appreciation for problem-solving, creativity, and the ability to build experiences that others can interact with. I enjoy exploring new technologies and improving my understanding of how websites are structured, styled, and brought to life.</p>
        <p id="intro">I am currently focused on strengthening my foundation in front-end development and creating projects that reflect both technical ability and clean design. I value precision, organization, and clarity in my work, and I strive to apply these qualities in every project I develop.</p>
        <p id="intro">Outside of my technical interests, I am motivated by continuous learning, self-improvement, and the pursuit of excellence. My long-term goal is to become a skilled and versatile web developer capable of contributing meaningful solutions in the digital field.</p>
